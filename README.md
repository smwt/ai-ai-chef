# AI AI, Chef

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to create an AI model that will create new recipes based on the user's preferences. The user can tell what type of food they want, a specific type of meal, the food of a certain culture, or just some ingredients that they want to work with. AI AI, Chef will then create new recipes from scratch with instructions and
present these to the user.

## Background

* Chef's block, stuck creatively in the kitchen?
* Want to try something new, but don't know what?
* Do you have some random ingredients that you don't know how to combine?

AI AI Chef will solve all of the above mentioned problems using a novel method for creating brand new recipes. Currently, these problems are mostly solved by googling recipes, or maybe watching some YouTube videos for inspiration. That's no fun, though! Something more fun would be to try something _completely_ new, and seeing what
the chef has planned for dinner! Curiosity is the main motivation in this project, and seeing if the problems above could be solved using some AI methods, and to see if the recipes that are generated are not only edible, but actually taste good.

Since there is a risk of AI AI Chef creating something horrible, not only bad tasting, but even lethal, it would be interesting to try to tackle the problem of creating safe recipes. Creating recipes that are safe for human consumption, but that are completely new, could translate into other applications where novel mixtures of various chemicals/substances/ingredients would benefit from the findings in this project.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
